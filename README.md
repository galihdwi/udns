# udns.me

Free subdomain for everyone. **CNAME** Only. We as a provider are not responsible for anything that happens. We do not hesitate to delete website subdomains related to negative things!

This domain is valid until **August 21, 2023** (I don't know what to do with this domain so I made this project).

Have a question or have a problem? Just open the [issue] in this repo!
